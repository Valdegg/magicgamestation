# Card Images Directory

Place your card images here following the naming convention:

`Card_Name_SET.jpg`

Examples:
- `Lightning_Bolt_A25.jpg`
- `Serra_Angel_M15.jpg`
- `Black_Lotus_LEA.jpg`

You already have 410 images in `frontend/card_images/`.
Run the link script to make them available:

```bash
cd frontend
./link_cards.sh
```

Or move/copy them here directly.
